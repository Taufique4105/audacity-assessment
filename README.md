# audacity-assessment
This project will cover the test automation tasks provided by Audacity IT Solutions; where I'll be using cypress with node and other standards.

Dependencies : 
install node.js, npm, cypress

Run tests using runner : 
npx cypress open

To run a single test function; use it.only() before that function.
